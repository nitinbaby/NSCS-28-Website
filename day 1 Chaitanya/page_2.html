  Superconductivity
   <h1> Zero DC Resistance</h1>
   <hr><!--Horizontal ruler-->
   <center> <p>In a superconductor, below a temperature called the “critical temperature”, the electric resistance very suddenly falls to zero. At zero resistance, the material conducts current perfectly. ... However, in a superconductor, the electric resistance is equal to zero although the flaws and vibrations still exist.</p></center>

   <h2> Meissner effect </h2> 
   <hr> <!--Horizontal ruler-->
   <center> <p>Meissner effect, the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of a material that is in the process of becoming a superconductor, that is, losing its resistance to the flow of electrical currents when cooled below a certain temperature, called the transition temperature, usually close to absolute zero.</p></center>
